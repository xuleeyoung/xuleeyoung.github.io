Hello! I’m Liyang Xu, a software engineer and researcher with a passion for innovation at the intersection of computer vision, machine learning, and generative AI. I hold a Master’s degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the **University of Michigan**, and a Bachelor's degree from **Shanghai Jiao Tong University**.

Over the years, I’ve developed expertise in building cutting-edge AI systems, fine-tuning large language models (LLMs), and creating impactful solutions in both academic and industrial settings. My recent work includes developing generative AI pipelines for visual and language tasks, such as a watermark removal system leveraging Stable Diffusion.

With proficiency in programming languages like Python, C++, and Java, my experience spans from crafting efficient algorithms to building scalable systems and deploying them in production environments. I am particularly fascinated by the potential of AI to redefine industries and improve lives.

Outside of work, I enjoy music, hiking, and cooking.

Feel free to connect with me or explore my blog, where I share insights into my work, tech tutorials, and thoughts on emerging trends in AI.
